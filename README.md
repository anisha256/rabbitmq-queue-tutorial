# Using RabbitMQ for Email Sending

## Traditional Email Sending via SMTP

In a traditional setup, when an application needs to send an email, it directly connects to an SMTP server (like Gmail SMTP, SendGrid, etc.) and sends the email using the SMTP protocol. This approach has some limitations and drawbacks:

- **Synchronous Communication:** Sending emails directly via SMTP can block the application's execution until the email is sent, potentially leading to slow response times for users.
- **Single Point of Failure:** If the SMTP server is unavailable or experiencing issues, the application's email sending functionality may fail.
- **Scalability Challenges:** Handling email sending within the application can become challenging to scale, especially in distributed or microservices architectures.

## Using RabbitMQ for Email Sending

By using RabbitMQ as an intermediary message broker, you can decouple the email sending process from the application, leading to several benefits:

- **Asynchronous Communication:** The application can publish email requests/messages to a RabbitMQ queue without waiting for email sending to complete. This allows the application to respond quickly to user requests.
- **Improved Reliability:** RabbitMQ provides message durability and reliability by persisting messages to disk and allowing for message retries, reducing the risk of message loss.
- **Scalability and Load Balancing:** RabbitMQ can handle a large number of messages and distribute them among multiple consumers (email senders) for parallel processing, improving scalability and performance.
- **Fault Tolerance:** RabbitMQ supports clustering and high availability setups, reducing the risk of a single point of failure compared to relying on a single SMTP server.

## Getting Started

To integrate RabbitMQ into your email sending system, follow these steps:

1. **Install RabbitMQ:** Start by installing RabbitMQ on your server or use a managed RabbitMQ service.
2. **Configure RabbitMQ:** Set up exchanges, queues, and bindings according to your application's requirements.
3. **Integrate RabbitMQ into Your Application:** Modify your application code to publish email requests/messages to RabbitMQ instead of directly sending emails via SMTP.
4. **Implement Consumers:** Create consumer(s) to process email messages from the RabbitMQ queue and send emails using SMTP or another email delivery service.
5. **Testing and Monitoring:** Test your email sending functionality thoroughly and set up monitoring to track the performance and reliability of your RabbitMQ-based email sending system.




# Setting up RabbitMQ and .NET Core Web API for Email Sending

## Step 1: Setup RabbitMQ using Docker-Compose

## Step 2: Create a .NET Core Web API Project

## Step 3: Install RabbitMQ Client NuGet Package
```
dotnet add package RabbitMQ.Client
```
## Step 4: Create RabbitMQ Configuration
Add RabbitMQ connection settings to the appsettings.json file:
```
{
  "RabbitMQ": {
    "HostName": "localhost",
    "Port": 5672,
    "UserName": "guest",
    "Password": "guest",
    "QueueName": "email_queue"
  },
}
```
